How to use:

You need Java 8 installed on your machine.

On Windows you can run the .bat file to generate a test-file with the configured size in the bat-file. Edit the bat-file to change the size of the generated file.

On other systems you will have to run the jar-file manually, or through a similar shell script. See the content of the bat-file.
